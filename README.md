igetpi
======

iGetPi is a GUI tool for Mac OSX that helps you manage your RaspberryPi OS image downloads. It downloads the images using Bittorrent so it's very fast and you automatically help the RaspberryPi Foundation by sharing your bandwidt trough the Bittorrent protocol which increases availability of the file you download for other users. The files only upload while you are downloading so it won't steal your bandwidt or anything.  This repository holds the iGetPi application files and holds a configured Git repository used to update available torrent files.
